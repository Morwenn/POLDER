POLDER - Open Source C++ Library
================================

POLDER is some personal library where I just throw whatever reusable
bit of code I write. POLDER has no specific purpose nor has it any
proper cohesion between its modules.

This folder contains the last version of the POLDER library.
There is no official documentation. However, you can generate
a bit of documentation for some of the modules using Doxygen,
I hope that they are still up-to-date.

Some examples are provided along with the library. The examples are
regularly recompiled, so they should always work.

POLDER uses some of the most recent C++ features, even some that
are not already standardized but that ought to work with some of
the most recent compilers. POLDER should compile with:
* g++ 4.9
* clang++ 3.5
