POLDER - Open Source C++ Library
================================

POLDER is some personal library where I just throw whatever reusable
bit of code I write. POLDER has no specific purpose nor has it any
proper cohesion between its modules.

This folder contains the last version of the POLDER library.
There is no official documentation. However, you can generate
a bit of documentation for some of the modules using Doxygen.

If you want to compile the code properly, you will need some C++11
support. Tested with the following compilers:
* GCC 4.7.2
