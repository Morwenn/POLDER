POLDER - Open Source C++ Library

This folder contains the last version of the POLDER library.
You can find some documentation at http://morwenn.wikia.com/wiki/POLDER
However, note that this documentation is written in french.

If you want to compile the code properly, you will need some C++11
support. I currently use the GCC 4.7.0 release.
